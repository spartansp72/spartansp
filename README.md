hey there, 
My name is Ali, I'm a passionate web designer and developer and hope to be a succesful one in the near future. 
I'm not extra smart and more of a creative person than a logical one. I guess thats the reason why front end seemed
more applealing to me when i took up the java full stack development course. I really hope i become succesful and can make my mom proud.
